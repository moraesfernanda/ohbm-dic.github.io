How can we achieve a balance of speakers at a scientific event? Finding speakers outside oneâ€™s network can be accomplished by contacting affinity groups (see our list of affinity groups: <p style="color:blue;">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCaCkVdhpeFKkPqYxK_9IGAj63PhRlo1iVb-kAkruEM/edit</p>) that are organized around specific identities to seek eligible individuals with the relevant expertise on a given topic. This will entail including speakers from underrepresented backgrounds and geographical locations as well as considering gender, ethnicity, and career levels when choosing co-presenters.
