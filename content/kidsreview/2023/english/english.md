Every decision counts! Decision-making is very important and can be studied in education, when we consider learning and test-taking. We can also look at it in athletes, for example, how quickly they make a decision to shoot or pass. Decision-making can be studied across all senses. The study of visual perception looks at how we perceive and interpret our surroundings using what we see, our vision. I study color, how we see it, and how it helps us make everyday decisions in a matter of seconds.

I'm a PhD student in psychology at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada but I'm originally from The Bahamas. I've studied psychology since I left high school and have always been most interested in cognitive psychology. Cognitive psychology studies topics like memory, language, and emotion; anything to do with thinking! My research is all about music and neuroscience, so I ask questions like, why we like music, how we learn to play an instrument, and what happens in the brain when we listen to or play music?

I am a Senior Scientist at the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto, Canada. I study how your brain helps you remember things. My research uses a special machine called MRI to take pictures of the brain so that we can see how the brain works. I also study how the brain changes as you get older. In my free time I like to be outdoors, run and bike, and spend time with my family. I have two children, a boy and a girl, that are 9 and 12 years old.

Exposure to knowledge is the key to motivation, which leads to growth. Over the past few years, I have been working with students in Ghana, West Africa to help transform their learning experience. I am the Senior Agreements Specialist at Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care and also the Founder for OnPoint Education, a program which focuses on transforming the learning environment of learners with opportunities such as renovating of schools, mentorship, career development and community services. I have my Bachelors degree in  Chemistry and Masters in Health Service Administration. I am very passionate about exposing students to various professions and academic topics as it enables them to make informed decisions about their future academic, professional and personal development.
