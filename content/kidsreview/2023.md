Applications for OHBM 2023 Multilingual Kids Review is now closed! We have received more than 20 applications for 12 different languages across the globe this year! These events will take place between May and July, and we are currently working together to prepare these events. We will also have the French in-person Live Review session during the annual meeting of OHBM 2023 in Montreal. See you all soon!
